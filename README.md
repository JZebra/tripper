# Tripper (name still WIP)

## MVP

* user can register, login, google auth
* user can log a trip
 * drug(s)
 * dosage(s)
 * start time
* user can add notes to a trip
 * timestamp
 * body


## Nice to have

* user can add [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry)
 * maybe as a subtype of notes?
* push notification reminders to snack/drink/walk
* links to spotify playlists
* visualizer
* a public feed like whisper/secret? Ideally people can share cool stuff
 * how to avoid trolls?
